Hello,

For this first project I will start with a simple remote. This remote is a IR remote to control things by Infrared, it can be a TV, a soundbar, a toy, really anything. 
This remote is based on a raspberry pi Pico, a IR receiver and emitter led, a 8 digit display and 3 buttons. Also, you will need a transistor and resistors: 8 of 220 ohms and 1 of 10 ohms. All the details of the connections can be found in the PDF file done by me. 
Here is the full scheme of the electronic circuit:

If there is any misunderstanding, don't hesitate to write me a message, I will try my best to answer your questions and modify my documentation.
